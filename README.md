India sees millions of students enrol in college programmes, and
millions of graduates apply to Universities abroad every year.
Evidently, these students require a robust online portal with
real-time information regarding Undergraduate, Postgraduate,
Doctorate and Diploma courses offered by National and
International Institutions, along with Scholarships and Grants based
on merit, income etc.
